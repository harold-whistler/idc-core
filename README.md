Instructions
-----------

### Building for 32-bit Windows

The next three steps are an example of how to acquire the source and build in an appropriate way.

Acquire the source and install dependencies.

    git clone https://gitlab.com/ID-Chain/idc-core.git
    sudo chmod -R a+rw idc-core
    cd idc-core/depends
    ./install-dependencies.sh

Set the default mingw-w32 g++ compiler option to auto (option 0) by default.

    sudo update-alternatives --config i686-w64-mingw32-g++

Build in the usual way.

    ./build-wins.sh

### Building for 64-bit Windows   

The next three steps are an example of how to acquire the source and build in an appropriate way.

Acquire the source and install dependencies.

    git clone https://gitlab.com/ID-Chain/idc-core.git
    sudo chmod -R a+rw idc-core
    cd idc-core/depends
    ./install-dependencies.sh

Set the default mingw-w64 g++ compiler option to posix (option 1).

    sudo update-alternatives --config x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++

Build in the usual way.

    ./build-wins.sh x64

### Build on Ubuntu

Use

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin; git clone https://gitlab.com/ID-Chain/idc-core.git; cd idc-core; depends/install-dependencies.sh; ./autogen.sh; ./configure --disable-tests --with-boost-libdir=/usr/local/lib; make clean; make -j$(nproc)


Add bitcoin repository for Berkeley DB 4.8

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin

Clone IDC-Core repository

    git clone https://gitlab.com/ID-Chain/idc-core.git

Build IDC-Core

    cd idc-core
    ./depends/install-dependencies.sh
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --disable-tests
    make -j$(nproc)


Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://gitlab.com/ID-Chain/idc-core/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of IDC-Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).


Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/qa) are installed) with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
